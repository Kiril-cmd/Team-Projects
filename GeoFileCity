Fifteen urn burials have been discovered in the municipality. There were late Bronze Age settlements south and west of the modern city. Several Iron Age buildings have been discovered south of town. There is also evidence of a Roman settlement, including a Gallo-Roman mausoleum and a small cache of coins. One or possibly several villas in the area may indicate the existence of a vicus near the town.

Around the 6th century AD the Alemanni founded a village. The first documented mention of "Wahinhofen" in 751 refers to today's Wenkenhof. The first mention of the name Riehen dates from 1113. Historical aerial photograph by Werner Friedli from 1951. In 1270, Riehen belonged to the Principality of Basel. From 1444 to 1446, Riehen was plundered and burned as a result of the battle of St. Jakob an der Birs, and from 1490 to 1493 during the Kappel feud. In 1522, Riehen came into the possession of the city of Basel and introduced the Reformation in 1528. During the Thirty Years' War, Riehen received a military occupation. The village was also visited by many refugees.
Fribourg;Fribourg;38365;9;702.0;531.0;French, German;1700;Thierry Steiert;The region around Fribourg has been settled since the Neolithic period, although few remains have been found. These include some flint tools found near Bourguillon, as well as a stone hatchet and bronze tools. A river crossing was located in the area during the Roman Era. The main activity in the Swiss plateau bypassed the area to the north, however, and was instead centered around the valley of the river Broye and Aventicum. Therefore, only a few remains from the Roman era have been found in Fribourg. These include the traces of a wall foundation on the plains near Pérolles.
